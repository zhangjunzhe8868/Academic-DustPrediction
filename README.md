1. land cover change provides a solution to extract the land surface height and cover from the DEM and ortho image
2. spatial explicit model proofs that the distribution of a land surface property could be inferenced if we have more samples and the sample mean of a land surface property is always a normal distribution if we have more draws of samples.
3. spatial isotropy provides a solution to detect the connectivity in 360 degree directions.
